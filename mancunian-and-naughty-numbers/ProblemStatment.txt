Mancunian, our favourite football fan, is a die-hard supporter of Manchester United Football Club. Being so, he is desperate 
to attend the grand unveiling of Jose Mourinho as the next manager of the club. But, his arch-nemesis Liverbird (who is a 
Liverpool fan) wants him to fail. Knowing that Mancunian is weak at mathematics, he has given him a problem to solve before 
the ceremony. Can you help Mancunian do it and thwart the evil plans of Liverbird?
